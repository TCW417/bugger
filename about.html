      <p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewtpeacock/">Andrew Peacock </a> is brand spankin' new to coding, and Codefellows is his first foray into the world of tech. His
        previous careers involved copious amounts of animal care, along with some kitchen and bar work on the side. His hobbies
        include competitive gaming, cooking, and stopping to pet every single dog that crosses his path.</p>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-whitaker/">Justin Whitaker</a> is a child of the 80's, and has fond memories of not being terrible at the easier levels of Frogger.
        Since he already spends so much time finding and squashing bugs in his code, and since he has studied bugs academically
        and has a special affinity for them, it felt natural to help create Bugger. Other things he has studied academically
        include computer hardware, microbiology, molecular biology, and jet engine maintenance. He's looking forward to combining
        his love of biology and tech hardware with his newly gained software development skills out in the wild.

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracywilliamskirklandwa/">Tracy Williams</a> comes to the Adjacent Truant Winery team from a long history of jobs both in and out of tech.
        Tracy graduated from the University of Washington in 1981 with a bachelor's in Computer Science with a focus on data
        structures. Since then he's worked as a software engineer, field applications engineer, and sales rep, and has filled
        various management roles up to VP Engineering & Quality. When he's not coding, Tracy enjoys spending time with his
        wife, Kim, riding one of his two motorcycles, or hanging out at his cabin in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.</p>
